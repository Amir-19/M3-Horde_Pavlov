# M3-Horde_Pavlov
Robot Module 3 (CMPUT 607)
In Robot Module 3, we try to extend the ideas from Robot Module 2 to make a system capable of forming a horde of GVFs and try to answer them in real-time. In addition to the horde module, we try to use Pavlovian control to change the behavior of the robot based on the prediction of a GVF, while the new behavior is hand crafted and not learned like control systems in RL context.
